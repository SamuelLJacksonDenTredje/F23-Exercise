        <p>The Fighter is a 2010 American biographical sports drama film directed by David O. Russell, and starring Mark Wahlberg (who also produced), Christian Bale, Amy Adams, and Melissa Leo. The film centers on the lives of professional boxer Micky Ward (Wahlberg) and his older half-brother Dicky Eklund (Bale). Adams plays Micky's girlfriend Charlene Fleming, and Leo portrays Micky and Dicky's mother, Alice Eklund-Ward. The film was inspired by the 1995 documentary that features the Eklund-Ward family, titled High on Crack Street: Lost Lives in Lowell. The film was released in select North American theaters on December 17, 2010, and in the United Kingdom on February 4, 2011. The Fighter grossed $129 million worldwide and received largely positive reviews, with critics praising the performances of Bale, Wahlberg, Adams, and Leo, with many comments about the former's weight, accent, and mannerisms. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, winning the awards for Best Supporting Actor (Bale) and Best Supporting Actress (Leo). It was the first film to win both awards since Hannah and Her Sisters in 1986.</p>
